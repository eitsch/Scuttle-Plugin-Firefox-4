h2. Scuttle Bookmarking Plugin for Firefox

I updated the original plugin and set the Max Version to 10.* so it could be installed on Firefox 10 and lower.

Works like a charm.  You can set which instance of scuttle you want to post bookmarks to in the preferences page.

h3. 0.9.0
I added a keyboard shortcut for shift-control b, because I hate using the mouse!
